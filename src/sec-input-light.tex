\section{Light Input Module}
\label{sec-input-light}

This input module enables your IoT device to sense how much light is
reaching the device. The module uses a small photo-resistor which is
similar in spirit to the potentiometer you experimented with in Lab 2.
For the potentiometer, the resistance varied as you twisted the knob on
the robot. For the photo-resistor, the resistance will vary based on how
much light reaches the device. The Arduino cannot directly sense
resistance, but it can sense an analog input voltage. We will use a
simple circuit called a voltage divider so that the voltage across the
photo-resistor is proportional to the resistance.

A sample circuit and Arduino code is shown below to get you started. This
code will print the analog reading from the photo-resistor on the serial
monitor, similar to how we printed the analog reading from the grayscale
sensor in Lab 2. After setting up the circuit and programming the
Arduino, open the serial monitor and note how the sensor reading varies
when the device is covered with your hand or when the device is placed
under a bright light.
